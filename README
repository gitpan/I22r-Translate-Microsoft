I22r-Translate-Microsoft

Microsoft backend for the Internationalizationizer translation
framework.

Translates content from one supported language to another, using
the Microsoft Translator webservice with the  I22r::Translate
framework. See the  I22r::Translate  for more information.

To use the Microsoft Translator API, you must set up an account
at the "Windows Azure Marketplace", choose a translator API
data plan, and "register an application" to get a "client ID"
and a "client secret" that you must provide to this module.
See the instructions below or the  I22r::Translate::Microsoft
documentation on how to get these credentials.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

TESTING WITH MICROSOFT DATA SERVICES CREDENTIALS

If you have registered for data services from Microsoft
and want to use your credentials with the unit tests in
this distribution, edit the bottom of the file
t/Constants.pm  before you run "make test". See the
documentation for the  I22r::Translate::Microsoft
package for some (possibly outdated) information about
how to obtain those credentials.

If you do not specify your credentials (a "client id"
and a "secret"), then the unit tests that interact with
Microsoft's data services will be skipped.

CONFIGURATION

This Microsoft backend is used in conjunction with the
I22r::Translate  framework. You configure the framework
with a call to  I22r::Translate->config  , passing a 
key-value pair with the key "I22r::Translate::Microsoft".
A minimal configuration would look like:

    I22r::Translate->config(
        'I22r::Translate::Microsoft' => {
            ENABLED => 1,
            CLIENT_ID => '... see below ...',
	    SECRET => '... see below ...'
        } );

The  CLIENT_ID  and  SECRET  parameters are required. See
the  I22r::Translate::Microsoft  and  I22r::Translate
documentation about other possible parameters.

GETTING CREDENTIALS FOR MICROSOFT TRANSLATOR API

You will need to obtain and provide a "client id" and
"client secret" to the  I22r::Translate  framework to
use the Microsoft backend. As of October 2012, here are
the instructions for getting these credentials:

1. If you don't have a  Windows Live ID , sign up
   for one at L<https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?lic=1>    

2. Visit  https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/microsofttranslator .
   Register for a "Windows Azure Marketplace" account.

3. Choose a Microsoft Translator data plan. One of the
   available plans is a free option for 2,000,000 characters/month.

4. Now you have to "register an application". Visit
   https://datamarket.azure.com/developer/applications  and hit the
   big green  REGISTER  button.
 
5. Choose any "Client ID" and "Name" for your application. The "URI"
   is also a required field, but the translator API doesn't use it, so 
   you can put whatever you like in that field, too.

   Make a note of the "Client ID"  value that you entered and the
   "Client secret" value that Microsoft provided. You will have to provide
   these values to the  I22r::Translate::Microsoft  backend configuration
   with the "CLIENT_ID" and "SECRET" keys.

Example: If your application registration screen (at
https::/datamarket.azure.com/developer/applications) looks like:

    * Client ID         angus
    * Name              The Beefinator
    * Client secret     ykiDjfQ9lztW/oFUC4t2ciPWH2nJS88FqXcQbs/Z9Y=7
    * Redirect URI      https://ilikebeef.com/
      Description       The multilingual Beefinator site

Then you would configure the Microsoft backend with

    I22r::Translate->config(
        'I22r::Translate::Microsoft' => {
            ENABLED => 1,
            CLIENT_ID => "angus",
            SECRET => "ykiDjfQ9lztW/oFUC4t2ciPWH2nJS88FqXcQbs/Z9Y=7"
        } );

(these are not real credentials).
